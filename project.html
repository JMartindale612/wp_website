						<h2>Project</h2>
						<p>Weaponised Pasts is a cross-disciplinary, Leverhulme-funded project examining the evolution of heritage-based hostility online and in the lab, led by Dr Chiara Bonacchi.</p>
					</header>
					<div class="box">
						<h3>Background</h3>
						<p>
							People interpret and experience objects, rituals and behaviours from the past, in order to shape their contemporary social identity. 
							Public-facing archaeologists describe the natural and cultural heritage around us, helping us to understand our inherited and shared information systems and social values. 
							However, in newspapers and on social media, actors modify information about archaeological findings before transmission, 
							giving them new cultural and social meanings, and sometimes using them to legitimise hostility towards members of perceived out-groups.
						</p>

						<p>
							This ‘heritage-based hostility’ is a growing area of interest for heritage and identity studies, 
							and is of great practical interest for public archaeology, 
							but it features conflicting theories and methods of analysis, 
							and lacks a unifying framework for future research to build on.

							<h3>Objectives</h3>
							<p>Our investigation will develop a theoretical framework for this weaponisation of the past, 
								and establish its causal mechanisms, by answering the following questions:</p>
							<p><ul>
								<li>What leads to the emergence and spread of heritage-based hostility?</li>
								<li>What role is played by content features, such as analogies used by journalists, 
								the heritage themes, and the general language chosen?</li>
								<li>What is the impact of the communication context (e.g., prestige bias), 
								and of the values of the social media users that are communicating and receiving this information?</li>
							</ul>
							</p>

				<!-- Methodology -->
				<section class = "container">
					<div class="box">
						<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
							<h3>Methodology</h3>
								<p>We will achieve our goals through two cross-disciplinary, interdependent strands of research:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Strand A:
											<ul>
												<li>Extraction of newspaper articles and social media posts from multiple countries to examine the linguistic content.</li>
												<li>Use of advanced, natural language processing algorithms to examine the content- and context-related features of heritage-based hostility.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Strand B:
											<ul>
												<li>Experimental manipulation of content- and context-related features to examine how individual differences affect the spread of heritage narratives.</li>
												<li>Examination of the transmission chain of newspaper articles about archaeological findings, and how it is transformed across the chain.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
									</ul>

							<h3>Impact</h3>
							<p>Our novel, methodologically ambitious approach will have a decisive impact on the way that 
								archaeological findings are communicated in the UK and internationally. <br>
								We will:
							<p><ol>
								<li>Identify the features of heritage content (e.g., types of heritage, themes, analogies and language) 
									that are associated with hostility on social media</li>
								<li>Understand how the content- and context-related aspects of communication on social media 
									(e.g., users' individual differences and social learning strategies) interact to predict the emergence, 
									transformation and spread of hostility</li>
								<li>Explain how different kinds of hostile narratives result from the evolution of archaeological communication on social media</li>
								<li>Provide recommendations for heritage communicators on how hostile narratives can be prevented</li>
							</ul>
