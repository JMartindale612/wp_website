## Detailed session information

Theme: Crossing the divide. Archaeology and the open world
Session format: Session with precirculated papers

**Session rationale**

The pervasive presence of archaeological heritage on social media is profoundly reshaping the theory and practice of public archaeology across communication, participation, and contestation. From text-based platforms such as Facebook and Wikipedia to image-based environments like Instagram and video-sharing platforms including YouTube and TikTok, archaeological heritage is increasingly encountered, interpreted, and mobilised in everyday digital practices.

This session explores how archaeological heritage on social media operates as an identity nexus, a contact zone, or a battlefield. On the one hand, social media platforms enable crowdsourcing, citizen science, and forms of “digital curation in the wild,” supporting participatory culture, co-creation, and creative engagement with the past. Archaeology-related online communities may function as affiliative or “creolised peripheral spaces,” facilitating interaction across national boundaries, professional divides, and distinctions between institutional (“capital I”) and informal (“small i”) identities.

On the other hand, these same environments are characterised by intense contestation. Archaeological heritage is frequently entangled with populist and nationalist discourses, pseudo-archaeology, memory wars, and the normalisation of heritage-based hostility and hate speech—dynamics that can spill over into offline conflict. Emotional responses to material remains are amplified through the semiotics of user-generated content and the algorithmic logics of platforms, raising critical questions about power, mediation, and responsibility.

Against this backdrop, the session brings together empirical, methodological, and theoretical contributions that critically examine the role of archaeology within contemporary networked communication and digital heritage ecosystems.
